# CSMaze
This will be a version of JMaze ported to C#. As stated in the JMaze description, I'm studing algorithms for making mazes. The algorithms used 
are defined at  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm and  http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm .  I still have some
work left in JMaze. I'll do my best the two in sync.  My ultimate goal is to port this to JavaScript using the AngularJS and Vue frameworks.

* add controls for building the maze
* add event handlers for the controls
* create the display panel
* build the maze grid structures and draw it
